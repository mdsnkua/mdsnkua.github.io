		<p > <b>Welcome </b>to the Laboratory of Analytics and Data Science at the <a href="https://en.econ.uoa.gr/">Department of Economics</a> at the <a href="https://en.uoa.gr/">National and Kapodistrian University of Athens</a>. The Laboratory of Analytics and Data Science of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens was founded in 2017. Our mission is to develop innovative ideas and techniques in the areas of Analytics, Data Science, and Artificial Intelligence.</p>
		<p>The last decade has been characterized by a dramatic rise in computer power and in data and scientific break-troughs. These advances, on the one hand, have created new perspectives (not only in science, but also in economy, business and industry) and, on the other hand, they have led to new challenges. Therefore, the need for a lab oriented towards these areas has been emerged.
		</p>    
		<p> Our aim is:
		    <ul>
			<li>To advance world-class research in the areas of (pure and applied) mathematics</li>
			<li>Data science and artificial intelligence</li>
		    </ul>
		</p>
		<p>Our work supports both theoretical developments and application to real problems. Much of our research is driven by real-world problems, since it is one of our primary objectives to bridge the gap between academic work and its applications.
		</p>  

		<p> Moreover, we are seeking to establish further collaboration with universities, businesses, public and third sector organizations. We undertake research that tackles challenges in science, business and economy.</p>
